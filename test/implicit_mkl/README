A simple implicit Euler step function for a system of 2 ODEs.  
The system of equations required by the implicit Euler step is 
solved using the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), which is a 
non-public domain software.  See Makefile to alter how the 
Intel Math Kernel Library is linked.

Makefile: type make to compile the code, this produces 
implicit_ode_mkl.exe.  Fourth order RIDC with 100 time 
steps can be run by:

$./implicit_ode_mkl.exe 4 100

ode.h: header file which defines the PARAMETER structure and 
	declares the functions defined in ode.cpp
ode.cpp: initializes the PARAMETER structure, and defines 
	functions for the initial condition and the right hand 
	side of the ODE system.
run.sh: shell script to run the executable for different numbers 
	of time steps for a convergence study.
convergence.m: matlab or octave script which uses the data produced 
	by run.sh to estimate the order of convergence.
