A simple explicit Euler step function for a system of 2 ODEs.

Makefile: type make to compile the code, this produces 
explicit_ode1.exe.  Fourth order RIDC with 100 time steps 
can be run by:
$./explicit_ode1.exe 4 100

ode.h: header file which defines the PARAMETER structure and 
	declares the functions defined in ode.cpp
ode.cpp: initializes the PARAMETER structure, and defines 
	functions for the initial condition and the right 
	hand side of the ODE system.
run.sh: shell script to run the executable for different 
	numbers of time steps for a convergence study.
convergence.m: matlab or octave script which uses the data 
	produced by run.sh to estimate the order of convergence.
reference/: reference solutions for this system of 2 ODEs
