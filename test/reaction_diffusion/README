An explicit Euler step function for a system of reaction diffusion PDE semi-discretized in space.

Makefile: type make to compile the code, this produces reaction_diffusion.exe.  Fourth order RIDC with 100 time steps can
be run by:
$./reaction_diffusion.exe 4 100000

ode.h: header file which defines the PARAMETER structure and declares the functions defined in ode.cpp
ode.cpp: initializes the PARAMETER structure, and defines functions for the initial condition and the right hand side of the ODE system.
run.sh: shell script to run the executable for different numbers of time steps for a convergence study.
convergence.m: matlab or octave script which uses the data produced by run.sh to estimate the order of convergence.
